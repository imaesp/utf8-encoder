# utf8-encoder
This script is designed to clean and reformat CSV files by converting **non-UTF-8** characters to **UTF-8** encoding.
It reads an input CSV file, ensures all text is properly encoded, and writes the cleaned data to a new CSV file. 
This process helps prevent character encoding issues when handling data from various sources, ensuring compatibility with databases and applications.
